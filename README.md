The Movies App is a simple Android application built using Kotlin and XML layouts. It features a clean user interface that displays a list of movies in a card layout, with options to view more details or navigate between screens. The app implements basic functionalities such as password validation, button navigation, and toggleable password visibility, making it a great foundation for learning Android development.

Features:
User-friendly UI layout designed with ConstraintLayout and CardView.
Input validations for user credentials (e.g., password length and complexity checks).
Dynamic navigation between multiple screens using explicit Intents.
Password visibility toggle for better user experience.
Proper use of Material Design components for modern styling.
Optimized layout handling for buttons and views with responsive design.
This project serves as an introduction to Android development with a focus on Kotlin and XML-based UI design.
